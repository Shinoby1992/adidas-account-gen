# Adidas Account Generator

## Description
A tool coded in Python that allows the user to generate accounts for Adidas using a catch-all domain (support for gmail tricks coming very shortly). The tool supports the recent captcha requirement change by Adidas.  Accounts are created in the format `PREFIX-RANDOMNUMBER@DOMAIN` with a random password. The prefix and domain can be edited in `config.json`.

## Requirements
- Python 3+
- `requests`
- `bs4`
- `flask`
- `colorama`
- `termcolor`
- `faker`

## Installation and Usage
### Method 1 (windows only)
Use these instructions if you are on windows. The generator will attempt to edit your hosts file if needed automatically. If this fails, just follow the instructions for editing your hosts file manually
- Run command prompt or other console application as admin
- Make sure you have installed all of the modules listed above, using `pip install` (or `pip3 install` if you have python2 too) to do so
- Edit `config.json` with a suitable editor e.g. sublime or atom (NOT NOTEPAD)
- `cd` into the directory location
- `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` if you also have python2 installed and added to path
- You must SOLVE CAPTCHAS MANUALLY (one per account you want to create)

### Method 2 (editing hosts file manually)
- You need to add the below line to your hosts file (google how to do this if you do not know)
- `127.0.0.1 fuckrsvpkingz.adidas.co.uk`
- Make sure you have installed all of the modules listed above, using `pip install` (or `pip3 install` if you have python2 too) to do so
- Edit `config.json` with a suitable editor e.g. sublime or atom (NOT NOTEPAD)
- `cd` into the directory location
- `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` if you also have python2 installed and added to path
- You must SOLVE CAPTCHAS MANUALLY (one per account you want to create)

## To-Do List
- [X] Add captcha support
- [X] Catch-all domain support
- [X] Random password generation
- [ ] Gmail dot-trick support
- [ ] Package to executables

## Notes
- Try check your email inbox for adidas account creation emails to make sure the accounts are actually being created
- If you choose 100 accounts, be prepared to solve 100 captchas. If you exit the script before all accounts have been created they will NOT be saved
- Accounts in the txt file are overwritten each time you run the tool, make sure to save the generated accounts elsewhere or you'll lose them
